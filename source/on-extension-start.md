# onExtensionStart

Not to be confused with `chrome.runtime.onStartup`, this event is actually called when _the extension_ starts. The native `onStartup` is not fired when the user manually disables and re-enables the extension.

In event pages and service workers, the background file is loaded and unloaded automatically; This event will ensure that the specified listener is only ever run once per "extension start."

> **Warning**
> Chrome has [serious issues around the background service worker](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1271154) so this might not work well for everyone.

```js
import {onExtensionStart} from 'webext-events';

async function listener() {
	console.log('Extension started now');
	await chrome.storage.local.set({started: Date.now()})
}

// Add the listener as soon as possible because the "onExtensionStart"
// event happens around 100ms after 'webext-events' is loaded
onExtensionStart.addListener(listener);
```
